design. While there is more to learn about both subjects, this is a good
point to stop, to summarize, and to look ahead.</p><h4><a name="(part._computing)"></a>Computing</h4><p>From elementary school to high school we learn to compute with one form of
data: numbers. Our first use of numbers is to count real things, say, three
apples, five friends, twelve bagels. Later we use numbers without any
appeal to concrete objects, but we have learned that numbers represent
information in the real world.</p><p>Computing with software is <span style="font-weight: bold;">algebra for all kinds of data</span>, not just
numbers. Nowadays, computer programs process representations of music,
molecules, law cases, electrical diagrams, architectures of houses, and
poems. Fortunately, we have learned to represent information with other
forms of data than just numbers. Otherwise, computing and programming would
become extremely tedious tasks.</p><p>Above all, we shouldn’t forget that computing means manipulating data
through proper basic operations.  Some operations create new values. Others
extract values from values.  Yet others modify values.  Finally, there are
also basic operations for determining to which class a piece of data
belongs. Built-in operations and functions are of course just another class
of data.  Definition is value creation; application is a form of value
extraction.<span class="refelem"><span class="refcolumn"><span class="refcontent">An object in a language such as Java is a function
with many different bodies. Each method represents a different way of
extracting data from an object.</span></span></span></p><p>When we define a function, we combine basic data operations. There are two
fundamental mechanisms for combining functions: function composition and
conditional expressions. The former means that the result of one function
becomes the argument of another one. The latter represents a choice among
several possibilities. When we eventually apply a function, we trigger a
computation.</p><p>In this book we have studied the laws of basic operations and the laws of
operation combination. Using these laws we can understand, in principle,
how any function processes its input data and how it produces its results
and effects. Because the computer is extremely fast and good at using these
laws, it can perform such evaluations for more data and for larger programs
than we can do with paper and pencil.</p><h4><a name="(part._programming)"></a>Programming</h4><p>Programs consist of definitions and expressions. Large programs consist of
hundreds and thousands of definitions and expressions. Programmers design
functions, use other programmer’s functions, leave, start on the
project. Without a strong discipline we cannot hope to produce software of
high quality. The key to programming discipline is to understand the design
of programs as a means to describe computations, which, in turn, is to
manipulate data through combinations of basic operations.</p><p>For that reason, the design of every program—<wbr>whether it is small and for
personal use or large and for business use—<wbr>must start with an analysis
of the surrounding world of information and a description of the classes of
data that represent the relevant information. If the classes are unusual or
new, we make up examples so we understand the organization of the class
description. After we understand the world of information surrounding our
project and its data representation, we make a plan.</p><p>A project plan identifies what data we wish to produce from the data that
the program will be given. In many cases, though, a program doesn’t process
data in just one way but in many ways. For example, a program for managing
bank accounts must handle deposits, withdrawals, interest calculations, tax
form generation, and many other tasks. In other cases, a program may have
to compute complex relationships. For example, a program for simulating a
ping-pong game must compute the movement of the ball, bounces on the table,
bounces from the paddle, paddle movements, etc.  In either case, we need to
describe what the various ways of processing data are and how they relate
to each other.  Then we rank them and start with the most important one. We
develop a working product, make sure that it meets our specifications, and
refine the product by adding more functions or taking care of more cases or
both.</p><p>Designing a function requires a rigorous understanding of what it computes.
Unless we can describe its purpose and its effect with concise statements,
we can’t produce the function. In almost all cases, it helps to make up
examples and work through the function’s computation by hand. For
complicated functions or for functions that use generative recursion,
we should include some examples with the purpose statements. The examples
illustrate the purpose and effect statements for others who may have to
read or modify the program.</p><p>Studying examples tends to suggest the basic design recipe. In most cases,
the design of a function is structural, even if it uses an accumulator or
structure mutation. In a few others, we must use generative recursion. For
these cases, it is important to explain the method for generating new
problems and to sketch why the computation terminates.</p><p>When the definition is complete, we must test the function. Testing
discovers mistakes, which we are bound to make due to all kinds of
reasons. The best testing process turns independently developed examples
into test suites, that is, a bunch of expressions that apply the function
to select input examples and compare its results and effects with expected
results and effects (mostly) automatically. If a mismatch is discovered,
the test suite reports a problem. The test suite should never be discarded,
only commented out. Every time we modify the function, we must use the test
suite to check that we didn’t introduce mistakes. If we changed the
underlying process, we may have to adapt the test suite mutatis
mutandis.</p><p>No matter how hard we work, a function (or program) isn’t done the first
time it works for our test suite. We must consider whether the development
of the function revealed new interesting examples and turn such examples
into additional tests. And we must edit the program. In particular, we must
use abstraction properly to eliminate all patterns wherever possible.</p><p>If we respect these guidelines, we will produce decent software. It will
work because we understand why and how it works. Others who must modify or
enhance this software will understand it, because we include sufficient
information on its development process. Still, to produce great software,
we must practice following these guidelines and also learn a lot more about
computing and programming than a first book can teach.</p><h4><a name="(part._moving-on)"></a>Moving On</h4><p>The knowledge and design skills from this book are a good foundation for
learning more about programming, computing, and even practical work on
software. First, the skills are good for learning the currently fashionable
collection of object-oriented languages,
especially Java. The two languages
share a philosophy of programming. In both settings, computing means
dealing with data, and programming means describing classes of values and
functions on them.  Unlike Racket, however, Java requires programmers to
spell out the class descriptions in Java, not just in English, and to place
function definitions with class descriptions. As a result, Java requires
programmers to learn a lot of syntactic conventions and is unsuitable as a
first language.</p><p></p><div class="SIntrapara">Second, a programmer must study the fundamental ideas of computing. Thus
far, our studies have focused on the laws of computing for data-oriented
programming languages.
Using the programming skills from this book, we can
design and implement a simulation of how the hardware computes. By doing so
we see the laws of computing from a radically different perspective. The
contrast points to a number of interesting questions:
</div><div class="SIntrapara"><ol><li><p>The two mechanisms of computing are rather different. Can one
mechanism compute what the other one can compute and vice versa?</p></li><li><p>The laws we have used are mathematical and abstract. They do not take
into account any real-world limitations. Does this mean that we can compute
whatever we wish?</p></li><li><p>The (simulated) hardware shows that computers have limitations. How
do these limitations affect what we can compute?</p></li></ol></div><div class="SIntrapara">Research on these questions created the discipline of computing and still
guides the design of most computing curricula.</div><p></p><p>Finally, the design knowledge of this book is enough to build some
real-world programs in Racket. DrRacket with its built-in Web browser and
email capabilities is such a program. Building large real-world programs,
however, requires some more knowledge about the functions that Racket uses
to create GUIs, to connect computers on a network, to script things such as
shells, web servers, networks, databases, etc. No matter what you do now,
don’t forget that good programming makes your life easy and fun.</p><blockquote class="SCentered"><p>Remember the design recipe, wherever you go.</p></blockquote><div class="navsetbottom"><span class="navleft">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="navright">&nbsp;&nbsp;<a indepth="true" href="part_six.html" title="backward to &quot;VI Accumulators&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">← prev</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a indepth="true" href="index.html" title="up to &quot;How to Design Programs, Second Edition&quot;" data-pltdoc="x">up</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="nonavigation">next →</span></span>&nbsp;</div></div></div><div id="contextindicator">&nbsp;</div>
